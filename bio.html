        <div class="bioInfo">Originally from the Pacific Northwest, Robert is a New York City based musical theatre singer, dancer, actor, pianist, accompanist, and song writer.

          Being homeschooled in Vancouver Washington with his 3 siblings made for an interesting childhood. They all grew up performing together with a community youth theater, and while my other siblings eventually phased out of theater, he couldn't get enough of it. After receiving an Associate's degree with an emphasis in music at Clark College, he began working professionally in the Portland OR area which eventually brought him to New York City in 2014.

          Regional work includes productions at theaters such as Tuacahn Center for the Arts, Fingerlakes Musical theater Festival, and Portland Center Stage. He also performed with Royal Caribbean Cruise line and will begin rehearsals for the national tour of Something Rotten Sept. 2018. Robert is always eager for a new experience and couldn't be happier living his dream and being apart of the wonderful world that is the theater community. </div>
